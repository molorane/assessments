Create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only 1's and 0's) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 7.

Note:

    Empty strings should be rejected.
    Your solution should reject strings with any character other than 0 and 1.
    No leading 0's will be tested unless the string exactly denotes 0.

 The Kata resembles the following two Kata
 - Regular expression for binary numbers divisible by 5
 - Binary multiple of 3
 
 The resemblance is that all are solvable by the chronology
 - 1) Find the finite automaton accepting the regular language
 - 2) Convert the finite automaton to a regular language string
   - 2.1) The conversion procedure is via
     - 2.1.1)

 The finite automaton for 7-divisibility is via
 - Â© 2010-2013 Stefan Hollos and Richard Hollos
 - http://www.exstrom.com/blog/abrazolica/posts/divautomata.html
 - The website does not provide a solution (i.e. a regular string)
 - The website only provides the deterministic finite automaton
 
 In the website diagram, state 0 (albeit not circled twice) is final.
 The machine has 7 states, only one is final.
 A second final state is contrived because 000*, of state 0, is not a word.
 
 The regular language expression attained is the following/
 - 0+((01+1)A*B)(0+1A*B)*
   - A = (0(01)*00+(101*0+0(01)*1)(001*0+11(01)*1)*(11(01)*00+10))
   - B = ((101*0+0(01)*1)(001*0+11(01)*1)*01+11)
 - The (001*0)* token is via state5-state3-state6-state5 in state 3 and 6 replacement
 - Binary choice (+) translates to |
 - Kleene star (*) is a regular expression token
